Soviet Socks Stockpile Software V1.0!

to run:
npm ci in server and webapp

npm start in server and webapp

instructions for CRUD commands:

-the commands will be processed based on the mode you select

-statements should be seperated by a double space(to help the server distinguish between spaces in names and spaces between different statements) e.g. name=my name  id=4 and not name=my name id=4

-create syntax: the input should contain one value for each field on the table e.g. id=x  name=y  email=z  phone=1234

-read syntax: the input should contain any values you want to search for, if you input several you will get results that match all conditions

-update: the input should include two statements - the first is the value you set and the second is the value by which the system will find what you want to change

-delete: the input should include the statements that whatever entries contain them you wish to delete

Enjoy!
